<p>I'm a Data Scientist turned Product Manager working with a Start-up in
 Bengaluru, India. I love to build intelligent products enabling SMBs to 
 make data-driven business decisions leveraging the latest and greatest 
 technological advancements in the field of Machine Learning. I'm currently 
 building a SaaS product called Blik.ai, which is an end-to-end, fully managed 
 intelligent BI platform for all other SaaS platforms. It enables businesses to 
 have complete oversight and help them optimize their operation with actionable 
 insights.</p>

<p>Other than this, I'm interested in Economics, Entrepreneurship, Marketing, 
and Technology. micro-SaaS is an area that recently grabbed my attention. 
I feel there is an immense revenue-generating potential with minimal effort.</p>

<p>I like to spend my leisure time playing Chess online, Cooking, Reading, 
and Travelling. I like to go on long bike rides in my Royal Enfield on weekends.</p>
